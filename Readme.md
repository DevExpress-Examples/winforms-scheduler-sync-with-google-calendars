# WinForms Scheduler - Synchronize appointments with Google events

This sample illustrates how to sync Scheduler appointments with events from your Google calendars.

Read the following [article](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/dotnet) and follow steps **1** to **3b** before you run the application (download the *credentials.json* file and include it into your project).

You should also remove all Google assemblies referenced in the project. Then go to **Project > Manage NuGet Packages...** and remove installed packages. To quickly re-install these packages and reference required libraries, drop the `DXGoogleCalendarSync` component from the Toolbox onto the form and click **Accept** in the appeared dialog. After all packages are successfully installed, you can remove the `DXGoogleCalendarSync` component.

Read the following help topic for additional information and instructions: [Synchronization With Google Calendars](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/120605/Controls-and-Libraries/Scheduler/Export-and-Import/Synchronization-With-Google-Calendars).
